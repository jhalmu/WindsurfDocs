# Deployment Guidelines

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Environment variables verified
   - [ ] Secrets management configured
   - [ ] Configuration files validated
   - [ ] Feature flags set correctly

2. **Security Checks**
   - [ ] Dependencies scanned
   - [ ] Security headers configured
   - [ ] Access controls verified
   - [ ] SSL/TLS certificates valid

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Assets minified
   - [ ] Images optimized
   - [ ] Caching configured
   - [ ] CDN setup verified

4. **Database**
   - [ ] Migrations prepared
   - [ ] Backup strategy in place
   - [ ] Rollback plan documented
   - [ ] Connection strings verified

## Deployment Process

1. **Staging Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Build verification
   npm run build
   
   # Test staging environment
   npm run test:e2e
   
   # Deploy to staging
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

2. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Final checks
   npm run verify
   
   # Deploy to production
   npm run deploy:prod
   
   # Post-deployment verification
   npm run test:smoke
   ```

## Monitoring Setup

1. **Application Metrics**
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage
   - User sessions

2. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - Server health
   - Database performance
   - Network status
   - Storage usage

## Rollback Procedures

1. **Quick Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to last stable version
   npm run rollback
   
   # Verify system health
   npm run health-check
   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Restore database
   npm run db:restore
   
   # Verify data integrity
   npm run db:verify
   ```

## Documentation Requirements

   - Session management
   - Cache synchronization
   - Database replication

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Resource allocation
   - Performance tuning
   - Capacity planning
   - Cost optimization

## Emergency Procedures

1. **Service Outage**
   - Incident response
   - Communication plan
   - Recovery steps
   - Post-mortem analysis

2. **Security Incident**
   - Containment steps
   - Investigation process
   - Remediation plan
   - Prevention measures
